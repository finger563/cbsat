Describe possible extensions to this work:

\begin{itemize}
\item effect of time synchronization resolution on performance
  prediction metrics
\item Investigate run-time classification of anomalies
\item investigate alternative methods for mitigation of attacks
\item Investigate effects other layers/protocols/etc have on the
  analysis and how they can be modeled
\end{itemize}
