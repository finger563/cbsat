abstract = {The IETF Differentiated Services Working Group has recently
standardized the assured forwarding (AF) per hop behavior (PHB). RFC
2597 recommends that an active queue management (AQM) technique be used
to realize the multiple levels of drop precedence required in the AF
PHB. The most widely used AQM scheme is RED (random early detection).
There are several ways to extend RED to a multi-level RED (MRED)
algorithm suitable for the AF PHB. This work compares two possible MRED
implementations and their ability to protect lower drop precedence
traffic: WRED (weighted RED) and RIO (RED with in/out). Based on an
empirical study, this paper makes the following key contributions:
firstly, the results show that for ON-OFF traffic, RIO is better than
WRED in protecting packets marked for treatment with lower drop
precedence. Secondly, for short-lived flows, RIO achieves higher
transactional rates than WRED. Thirdly, for bulk transfer, RIO and WRED
achieve comparable long-term throughput. Finally, this paper also
reports the results of experiments with 3 different models for setting
of WRED and RIO parameters. We recommend the \&amp;ldquo;staggered\&amp;rdquo;
model as best suited to achieve the requirements of the AF PHB},

@article{Flegkas2002,
abstract = {Policy-based management can guide the behavior of a network or
distributed system through high-level declarative directives that are
dynamically introduced, checked for consistency, refined, and evaluated,
resulting typically in a series of low-level actions. We actually view
policies as a means of extending the functionality of management systems
dynamically, in conjunction with preexisting hard-wired management
logic. We first discuss the policy management aspects of architecture
for managing quality of service in IP DiffServ networks as presented by
Trimintzios et al. (see IEEE Commun. Mag., Special Issue in IP
Operations and Management, vol.39, no.5, p.80-88, 2001), and focus on
the functionality of the dimensioning and resource management aspects.
We then present an analysis of the policies that can influence the
dimensioning behavior as well as the inconsistencies that may be caused
by the introduction of such policies. Finally, we describe the design
and implementation of the generic policy consumer component and present
the current implementation status},

@article{Mahadevan1999,
abstract = {Guaranteeing Quality of Service (QoS) in the Internet has been
proposed using two different models-the Integrated services (IntServ)
model and the Differentiated services (DiffServ) model. IntServ uses the
per-flow approach to provide guarantees to individual streams, while
DiffServ provides aggregate assurances for a group of applications. Both
these models have been designed to work for wired networks. Our aim is
to identify modifications that need to be made to make them suitable for
wireless networks. In this paper, some possible modifications to the
IntServ and DiffServ models for use with wireless networks are
presented. A description of an experimental testbed built to implement
and test the proposed enhancements, and results from the testbed are
also provided},
