abstract = {A calculus is developed for obtaining bounds on delay and
buffering requirements in a communication network operating in a packet
switched mode under a fixed routing strategy. The theory developed is
different from traditional approaches to analyzing delay because the
model used to describe the entry of data into the network is
nonprobabilistic. It is supposed that the data stream entered into the
network by any given user satisfies burstiness constraints. A data
stream is said to satisfy a burstiness constraint if the quantity of
data from the stream contained in any interval of time is less than a
value that depends on the length of the interval. Several network
elements are defined that can be used as building blocks to model a wide
variety of communication networks. Each type of network element is
analyzed by assuming that the traffic entering it satisfies bursting
constraints. Under this assumption, bounds are obtained on delay and
buffering requirements for the network element; burstiness constraints
satisfied by the traffic that exits the element are derived},

analyze the flow of data in a network consisting of the interconnection
of network elements is presented. Assuming the data that enters the
network satisfies burstiness constraints, burstiness constraints are
derived for traffic flowing between network elements. These derived
constraints imply bounds on network delay and buffering requirements. By
example, it is shown that the use of regulator elements within the
network can reduce maximum network delay. It is also found that such a
use of regulator elements can enlarge the throughput region where finite
bounds for delay are found. Finally, it is shown how regulator elements
connected in series can be used to enforce general burstiness
constraints},

@inproceedings{networkEmulation_SEDLANE_2007,
abstract = {Ad hoc networks have gained place in the research area recently. There are many researches regarding different topics related to such networks, such as routing, media access control, security, scalability, and many others. There are two usual methods to test and evaluate ad hoc networks performance: simulations and real test-beds. A network emulator is a tradeoff between pure simulations and real test-beds. Here, we propose a multi-hop wireless ad hoc network emulator that uses the advantages of network simulator (NS-2) and traffic shaping tool (DummyNet), that we called SEDLANE [simple emulation of delay and loss for ad hoc networks environment]. SEDLANE is a network emulator that is based on TCP behaviour characteristics. Using SEDLANE, we can emulate a whole multihop ad hoc network through the data packet loss and round trip time (RTT) values over the TCP connection. SEDLANE helps testing and evaluating ad hoc network protocols using very simple and inexpensive test-bed configuration. The results confirm that; introducing SEDLANE within a simple configuration network (possibly 2 nodes) gives exactly the same results as those obtained when simulating such networks.},

abstract = { The network simulator ns-2 implements both wireless networks and emulation \&amp;\#8212; a feature that allows to simulate a network environment among real stations. However, the real-time requirements of a network emulation introduce an inaccurate timing behavior of the simulator scheduler. These timing errors have a negative impact on the performance of network protocols in ns-2. Even more, they lead to false simulation results in the IEEE 802.11 protocol implementation. In this paper we present performance improvements in ns-2, that increase the accuracy of its virtual clock and the the exactness of the real-time simulation. Then we describe a simple time monitoring and correction technique that ensures a timely correct execution of network protocols and enables wireless network emulation in ns-2.},

The motivation of this paper is to provide a guide to researchers undertaking packet-level network simulations. The simulator outputs were compared to the output from a live network testbed. The experimental comparison consisted of deploying both CBR data traffic, and an FTP session, both on the network testbed and the simulators. CBR data traffic was used due to its simplicity of modeling. A custom analysis tool was employed to examine the behavior of the network in different background traffic scenarios. The same scenarios were then recreated in the simulators in order to ascertain their realism. The results show the necessity of fine-tuning the parameters within a simulator so that it closely tracks the behavior of a real network. Keywords:},

abstract = {The Real-Time Calculus (RTC) framework proposed in [Chakraborty et al., DATE 2003] and subsequently extended in [Wandeler et al., Real-Time Systems 29(2-3), 2005] and a number of other papers is geared towards the analysis of real-time systems that process various types of streaming data. The main strength of RTC is a count-based abstraction, where arrival patterns of event streams are specified as constraints on the number of events that may arrive over any specified time interval. In this framework, algebraic techniques can be used to compute system properties in a compositional way. However, the main drawback of RTC is that it cannot model state information in a natural way. For example, when a scheduling policy depends on the fill-level of a certain buffer or there is a shift from one type of data stream into another. In this paper, we extend RTC in a manner that enables state information to be easily captured while limiting the state-space explosion caused by fine grained state-based models such as timed automata. Our model, called "multi-mode RTC", specifies event streams as finite automata whose states are annotated with functions that specify constraints on the arrival patterns of event streams or the service available to process them. Our new framework combines the expressiveness of state-based models with the algebraic and compositional features of the RTC formalism. In particular, system properties within a single mode can be analyzed using the RTC-based algebraic techniques and state-space exploration can be used to piece together the results obtained algebraically for the individual modes. We show how to determine typical system properties with the focus on efficient approximate techniques and illustrate the advantages of multi-mode RTC using two case studies.},

These components often implement different scheduling/arbitration policies, have different interfaces, and are supplied by different vendors. Hence, compositional techniques for modeling and analyzing such platforms are of interest. In prior work, the real-time calculus framework has proven to be very effective in this regard. However, real-time calculus has heretofore been limited to systems with uniprocessor processing elements, which is a serious impediment given the advent of multicore technologies. In this paper, a two-step approach is proposed that allows the power of real-time calculus to be applied in globally-scheduled multiprocessor systems: first, assuming that job response-time bounds are given, determine whether these bounds are met; second, using these bounds, determine the resulting residual processor supply and streams of job completion events using formalisms from real-time calculus. For this methodology to be applied in settings where response-time bounds are not specified, such bounds must be determined. Though this is an issue that warrants further investigation, a method is discussed for calculating such bounds that is applicable to a large family of fixed job-priority schedulers. The utility of the proposed analysis framework is demonstrated using a case study.},

missed, whereas, in a soft or firm real-time system, deadlines can be

most hard real-time systems could miss some deadlines provided that it
happens in a known and predictable way. Also, adding predictability on
the pattern of missed deadlines for soft and firm real-time systems is
desirable, for instance, to guarantee levels of quality of service. We
introduce the concept of weakly hard real-time systems to model
real-time systems that can tolerate a clearly specified degree of missed
deadlines. For this purpose, we define four temporal constraints based
on determining a maximum number of deadlines that can be missed during a
window of time (a given number of invocations). This paper provides the
theoretical analysis of the properties and relationships of these
constraints. It also shows the exact conditions under which a constraint
is harder to satisfy than another constraint. Finally, results on fixed

Founded on min-plus convolution and de-convolution, network calculus obeys a strong analogy to system theory. Yet, system theory has been extended beyond the time domain applying the Fourier transform thereby allowing for an efficient analysis in the frequency domain. A corresponding dual domain for network calculus has not been elaborated, so far. In this paper we show that in analogy to system theory such a dual domain for network calculus is given by convex/concave conjugates referred to also as the Legendre transform. We provide solutions for dual operations and show that min-plus convolution and de-convolution become simple addition and subtraction in the Legendre domain. Additionally, we derive expressions for the Legendre domain to determine upper bounds on backlog and delay at a service element and provide representative examples for the application of conjugate network calculus. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Prior work on network coding is mainly theoretical and focuses on multicast traffic. This paper aims to bridge theory with practice; it addresses the common case of unicast traffic, dynamic and potentially bursty flows, and practical issues facing the integration of network coding in the current network stack. We evaluate our design on a 20-node wireless network, and discuss the results of the first testbed deployment of wireless network coding. The results show that using COPE at the forwarding layer, without modifying routing and higher layers, increases network throughput. The gains vary from a few percent to several folds depending on the traffic pattern, congestion level, and transport protocol.},

In this paper, we present an analytical approach for end-to-end delay analysis in wireless networks that employ inter-session coding. Prior work on performance analysis in wireless network coding mainly focuses on the throughput of the overall network. Our approach aims to analyze the end-to-end delay performance of each flow in the network. The theoretical basis of our approach is network calculus. In order to apply network calculus to the analysis of wireless network coding, we address three specific problems: identifying traffic flows, characterizing broadcast links, and measuring coding opportunities. We make three main contributions. First, we obtain theoretical formulations for computing the delay bounds of bursty flows in wireless networks employing network coding. Second, based on the formulations, we figure out the factors that affect the end-to-end delays, and find an interesting phenomenon that, as traffic grows, the overall delay can potentially decrease. Third, in order to exploit the benefit of our findings, we introduce a new scheduling scheme that can improve the performance of current practical wireless network coding.},

@misc{Ciucu2012,
abstract = {ACM Sigcomm 2006 published a paper [26] which was perceived to unify the deterministic and stochastic branches of the network calculus (abbreviated throughout as DNC and SNC) [39]. Unfortunately, this seemingly fundamental unification---which has raised the hope of a straightforward transfer of all results from DNC to SNC---is invalid. To substantiate this claim, we demonstrate that for the class of stationary and ergodic processes, which is prevalent in traffic modelling, the probabilistic arrival model from [26] is quasi-deterministic, i.e., the underlying probabilities are either zero or one. Thus, the probabilistic framework from [26] is unable to account for statistical multiplexing gain, which is in fact the raison d'\{\^{e}\}tre of packet-switched networks. Other previous formulations of SNC can capture statistical multiplexing gain, yet require additional assumptions [12], [22] or are more involved [14], [9] [28], and do not allow for a straightforward transfer of results from DNC. So, in essence, there is no free lunch in this endeavor. Our intention in this paper is to go beyond presenting a negative result by providing a comprehensive perspective on network calculus. To that end, we attempt to illustrate the fundamental concepts and features of network calculus in a systematic way, and also to rigorously clarify some key facts as well as misconceptions. We touch in particular on the relationship between linear systems, classical queueing theory, and network calculus, and on the lingering issue of tightness of network calculus bounds. We give a rigorous result illustrating that the statistical multiplexing gain scales as \{$\Omega$\}($\backslash$sqrt\{\}N), as long as some small violations of system performance constraints are tolerable. This demonstrates that the network calculus can capture actual system behavior tightly when applied carefully. Thus, we positively conclude that it still holds promise as a valuable systematic methodology for the performance analysis of computer and communication systems, though the unification of DNC and SNC remains an open, yet quite elusive task.},

Sophisticated$\backslash$nclassification, marking, policing, and shaping operations need only be$\backslash$nimplemented at network boundaries or hosts. Network resources are$\backslash$nallocated to traffic streams by service provisioning policies which$\backslash$ngovern how traffic is marked and conditioned upon entry to a$\backslash$ndifferentiated services-capable network, and how that traffic is$\backslash$nforwarded within that network. A wide variety of services can be$\backslash$nimplemented on top of these building blocks.},

We use a service curve representation of radio links which facilitates an efficient analysis of radio networks. We investigate fading channels with memory and our results show that the fading speed impacts service guarantees significantly. Numerical performance bounds are provided for an example taken from cellular radio communications for which the effects of opportunistic scheduling are quantified.

Its elegance steins from intuitive convolution formulas for concatenation of deterministic servers. Recent research dispenses with the worst-case assumptions of network calculus to develop a probabilistic equivalent that benefits from statistical multiplexing. Significant achievements have been made, owing for example to the theory of effective bandwidths; however, the outstanding scalability set up by concatenation of deterministic servers has not been shown. This paper establishes a concise, probabilistic network calculus with moment generating functions. The presented work features closed-form, end-to-end, probabilistic performance bounds that achieve the objective of scaling linearly in the number of servers in series. The consistent application of moment generating functions put forth in this paper utilizes independence beyond the scope of current statistical multiplexing of flows. A relevant additional gain is demonstrated for tandem servers with independent cross-traffic},

abstract = {In recent years service curves have proven a powerful and versatile model for performance analysis of network elements, such as schedulers, links, and traffic shapers, up to entire computer networks, like the Internet. The elegance of the concept of service curve is due to intuitive convolution formulas that determine the data departures of a system from its arrivals and its service curve. This fundamental relation constitutes the basis of the network calculus and relates it to systems theory, however, under a different, so-called min-plus algebra. As in systems theory, the particular strength of the minplus convolution is the ability to concatenate tandem systems along a network path. This facilitates the notion of network service curve that has the expressiveness to characterize whole networks by a single transfer function. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art of the deterministic and the recent probabilistic network calculus. It discusses the concept of service curves, its use in the network calculus, and the relation to systems theory under the min-plus algebra. Service curve models of common schedulers and different types of networks are reviewed and methods for identification of a system's service curve representation from measurements are discussed. After recapitulating the state of knowledge on time-varying min-plus systems theory, stochastic service curve models are surveyed. These models allow utilizing the statistical multiplexing gain in a network calculus framework that features end-to-end network analysis by convolution of service curves.},

abstract = {SoCs for multimedia applications typically use only one port to off-chip DRAM for cost reasons. The sharing of interconnect and the off-chip DRAM port by several IP blocks makes the performance of a SoC under design hard to predict. Network calculus defines the concept of flow and has been successfully used to analyse the performance of communication networks. We propose to apply network calculus to the verification of memory access latencies. Two novel network elements, packet stretcher and packet compressor, are used to model the SoC interconnect and DRAM controller. We further extend the flow concept with a degree and make use of the peak characteristics of a flow to tighten the bounds in the analysis. We present a video playback case study and show that the proposed application of network calculus allows us to statically verify that all requirements on memory access latency are fulfilled.},

abstract = {Stochastic network calculus is a theory for performance guarantee analysis of Internet networks. Originated in early 1990s, stochastic network calculus has its foundation on the min-plus convolution and max-plus convolution queueing principles. Although challenging, it has shown tremendous potential in dealing with queueing type problems encountered in Internet networks. By focusing on bounds, stochastic network calculus compliments the classical queueing theory. This paper provides an overview of stochastic network calculus from the queueing principle perspective and presents an outlook by discussing crucial yet still open challenges in the area.},

abstract = {Network calculus is a theory dealing with queueing type problems encountered in computer networks, with particular focus on quality of service guarantee analysis. Queueing theory is the mathematical study of queues, proven to be applicable to a wide area of problems, generally concerning about the (average) quantities in an equilibrium state. Since both network calculus and queueing theory are analytical tools for studying queues, a question arises naturally as is if and where network calculus and queueing theory meet. In this paper, we explore queueing principles that underlie network calculus and exemplify their use. Particularly, based on the network calculus queueing principles, we show that for GI/GI/1, similar inequalities in the theory of queues can be derived. In addition, we prove that the end-to-end performance of a tandem network is independent of the order of servers in the network even under some general settings. Through these, we present a network calculus perspective on queues and relate network calculus to queueing theory.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose to speed up the simulation performance for TCP-operated networks by incorporating network calculus-based models in a simulation framework. In the simulation framework, we describes the operational properties of TCP congestion control, additive increase and multiplicative decrease (AIMD) and slow start, together with the queue discipline in the domain of network calculus. In order to determine network calculus models for TCP congestion, we first devise a simple TCP throughput model which approximately determines the range of per-flow throughput that one TCP can attain in a given interval, given the number of packet losses in the interval. We then exploit the TCP model to define a collection of network calculus theorems that regulate TCP flows in the range between the upper- and lower-limits on the TCP per-flow throughput in the corresponding interval. Finally, we incorporate the derived rules (theorems) into ns-2 to obtain a network calculus-based (NC-based) simulation, and carry out both the NC-based and the packet-level simulation to evaluate the performance gain and accuracy of the NC-based simulation, where the former is represented in perspective of the execution time (wall time) incurred in conducting the simulations and the later is evaluated in terms of the difference between results obtained in both the packet-level and NC-based simulation. The simulation results indicate that an order of magnitude or more (maximally 30 times) improvement in the execution time is achieved and the performance improvement becomes more salient as the network size increases in perspective of network-link capacities and the number of flows. The discrepancy observed between the NC-based simulation and the packet-level simulation, on the other hand, is minimally 1-2\% and maximally 8-12\% in a wide spectrum of network topologies and traffic loads. Additionally the results also indicate that the NC-based simulation outperforms a fluid-model-based simulation realized with the use of the time-stepped hybrid simulation technique, and that the performance improvement of the NC-based simulation is still held in IEEE 802.11-based wireless networks and also immune to the type of the simulation platform consisting of ns-2, operating system, and hardware specification. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It is shown that a general version of effective bandwidth can be expressed within the framework of a probabilistic version of the network calculus, where both arrivals and service are specified in terms of probabilistic bounds. By formulating well-known effective bandwidth expressions in terms of probabilistic envelope functions, the developed network calculus can be applied to a wide range of traffic types, including traffic that has self-similar characteristics. As applications, probabilistic lower bounds are presented on the service given by three different scheduling algorithms: static priority, earliest deadline first, and generalized processor sharing. Numerical examples show the impact of specific traffic models and scheduling algorithms on the multiplexing gain in a network.},

There is a lot of work including an elegant theory under the name of network calculus, which focuses on analysis of deterministic worst case QoS performance bounds. In the meantime, researchers have studied stochastic QoS performance for specific schedulers. However, most previous works on deterministic QoS analysis or stochastic QoS analysis have only considered a server that provides deterministic service, i.e.??deterministically bounded rate service. Few have considered the behavior of a stochastic server that provides input flows with variable rate service, for example wireless links. In this paper, we propose a stochastic network calculus to analyze the end-to-end stochastic QoS performance of a system with stochastically bounded input traffic over a series of deterministic and stochastic servers. We also prove that a server serving an aggregate of flows can be regarded as a stochastic server for individual flows within the aggregate. Based on this, the proposed framework is further applied to analyze per-flow stochastic QoS performance under aggregate scheduling. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In (J. Schmitt and U. Roedig, 2005) , a sensor network calculus was introduced in order to accommodate a worst-case analysis of WSNs. This sensor network calculus focused on the communication aspect in WSNs, but had not yet a possibility to treat in-network processing in WSNs. In this work, we now incorporate in-network processing features as they are typical for WSNs by taking into account computational resources on the sensor nodes. Furthermore, we propose a simple, yet effective priority queue management discipline which achieves a good balance of response times across sensor nodes in the field.},

To deal with the fluctuation in both the power generation and demand, we borrow the ideas from stochastic network calculus and build a stochastic model for the power supply reliability with different renewable energy configurations. To illustrate the validity of the model, we conduct a case study for the integration of renewable energy sources into the power system of an island off the coast of Southern California. Performance of the hybrid system under study is assessed by employing the stochastic model, e.g., with a set of system configurations, the long-term expected Fraction of Time that energy Not-Served (FTNS) of a given period can be obtained.},

abstract = {A fractionated spacecraft is a cluster of independent modules that interact wirelessly to maintain cluster flight and realize the functions usually performed by a monolithic satellite. This spacecraft architecture poses novel software challenges because the hardware platform is inherently distributed, with highly fluctuating connectivity among the modules. It is critical for mission success to support autonomous fault management and to satisfy real-time performance requirements. It is also both critical and challenging to support multiple organizations and users whose diverse software applications have changing demands for computational and communication resources, while operating on different levels and in separate domains of security. The solution proposed in this paper is based on a layered architecture consisting of a novel operating system, a middleware layer, and component-structured applications. The operating system provides primitives for concurrency, synchronization, and secure information flows; it also enforces application separation and resource management policies. The middleware provides higher-level services supporting request/response and publish/subscribe interactions for distributed software. The component model facilitates the creation of software applications from modular and reusable components that are deployed in the distributed system and interact only through well-defined mechanisms. Two cross-cutting aspects - multi-level security and multi-layered fault management - are addressed at all levels of the architecture. The complexity of creating applications and performing system integration is mitigated through the use of a domain-specific model-driven development process that relies on a dedicated modeling language and its accompanying graphical modeling tools, software generators for synthesizing infrastructure code, and the extensive use of model-based analysis for verification and validation.},

class of local image features. The features are invariant to image
scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to

similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are
used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently
detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable
points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local
geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in
multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as
input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate
object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding
a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters.
Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved

abstract = {We are developing a dual panel breast-dedicated PET system using LSO scintillators coupled to position sensitive avalanche photodiodes (PSAPD). The charge output is amplified and read using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the coincidence timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be improved using certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the calibration problem as a convex optimization problem and use the RENA-3s analog-based timing system to correct the measured data for time dispersion effects from correlated noise, PSAPD signal delays and varying signal amplitudes. The direct solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix inversion that grows order (n3) with the number of parameters. An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to approximate the inversion grows order (n). The inversion does not need to run to convergence, since any gains at high iteration number will be low compared to noise amplification. The system calibration method is demonstrated with measured pulser data as well as with two LSO-PSAPD detectors in electronic coincidence. After applying the algorithm, the 511keV photopeak paired coincidence time resolution from the LSO-PSAPD detectors under study improved by 57\%, from the raw value of 16.30.07 ns FWHM to 6.920.02 ns FWHM (11.520.05 ns to 4.890.02 ns for unpaired photons).},

We describe how support vector training can be practically implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping technique which is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear in the data. We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even infinite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed high accuracy of SVMs, which we review. Results of some experiments which were inspired by these arguments are also presented. We give numerous examples and proofs of most of the key theorems.

Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers \& results.},

This paper proposes a server model for characterizing a service process with the consideration of the stochastic nature of service. The proposed server model is defined based on a probabilistic bound on the cumulative packet service time. In addition, two traffic models characterizing the arrival process by the cumulative packet inter-arrival time are defined. Based on the proposed models, stochastic service guarantees including delay bound and backlog bound and the output characterization are explored. A two-class Probabilistic Priority server system, a generic server model which can model systems serving packets probabilistically, is analyzed to illustrate that the proposed models can facilitate performance analysis.},

abstract = {Service-based systems that are dynamically composed at runtime to provide complex, adaptive functionality are currently one of the main development paradigms in software engineering. However, the Quality of Service (QoS) delivered by these systems remains an important concern, and needs to be managed in an equally adaptive and predictable way. To address this need, we introduce a novel, tool-supported framework for the development of adaptive service-based systems called QoSMOS (QoS Management and Optimization of Service-based systems). QoSMOS can be used to develop service-based systems that achieve their QoS requirements through dynamically adapting to changes in the system state, environment, and workload. QoSMOS service-based systems translate high-level QoS requirements specified by their administrators into probabilistic temporal logic formulae, which are then formally and automatically analyzed to identify and enforce optimal system configurations. The QoSMOS self-adaptation mechanism can handle reliability and performance-related QoS requirements, and can be integrated into newly developed solutions or legacy systems. The effectiveness and scalability of the approach are validated using simulations and a set of experiments based on an implementation of an adaptive service-based system for remote medical assistance.},

In congested networks, traditional rate adaptation algorithms have been shown to choose lower data-rates for packet transmissions, leading to reduced total network throughput and capacity. A primary reason for this behavior is the lack of real-time congestion measurement techniques that can assist in the identification of congestion-related packet losses in a wireless network. In this work, we first propose two real-time congestion measurement techniques, namely an active probe-based method called Channel Access Delay, and a passive method called Channel Busy Time. We evaluate the two techniques in a testbed network and a large WLAN connected to the Internet. We then present the design and evaluation of Wireless cOngestion Optimized Fallback (WOOF), a rate adaptation scheme that uses congestion measurement to identify congestion-related packet losses. Through simulation and testbed implementation we show that, compared to other well-known rate adaptation algorithms, WOOF achieves up to 300 percent throughput improvement in congested networks.},

abstract = {A sensible design of wireless networks involves striking a good balance between an aggressive reuse of the spectral resource throughout the network and managing the resulting co-channel interference. Traditionally, this problem has been tackled using a ldquodivide and conquerrdquo approach. The latter consists in deploying the network with a static or semidynamic pattern of resource reutilization. The chosen reuse factor, while sacrificing a substantial amount of efficiency, brings the interference to a tolerable level. The resource can then be managed in each cell so as to optimize the per cell capacity using an advanced air interface design. In this paper, we focus our attention on the overall network capacity as a measure of system performance. We consider the problem of resource allocation and adaptive transmission in multicell scenarios. As a key instance, the problem of joint scheduling and power control simultaneously in multiple transmit-receive links, which employ capacity-achieving adaptive codes, is studied. In principle, the solution of such an optimization hinges on tough issues such as the computational complexity and the requirement for heavy receiver-to-transmitter feedback and, for cellular networks, cell-to-cell channel state information (CSI) signaling. We give asymptotic properties pertaining to rate-maximizing power control and scheduling in multicell networks. We then present some promising leads for substantial complexity and signaling reduction via the use of newly developed distributed and game theoretic techniques.},

abstract = { In order to cater to the diversity of terminals and networks, efficient, and flexible adaptation of multimedia content in the delivery path to end consumers is required. To this end, it is necessary to associate the content with metadata that provides the relationship between feasible adaptation choices and various media characteristics obtained as a function of these choices. Furthermore, adaptation is driven by specification of terminal, network, user preference or rights based constraints on media characteristics that are to be satisfied by the adaptation process. Using the metadata and the constraint specification, an adaptation engine can take an appropriate decision for adaptation, efficiently and flexibly. MPEG-21 Part 7 entitled Digital Item Adaptation standardizes among other things the metadata and constraint specifications that act as interfaces to the decision-taking component of an adaptation engine. This paper presents the concepts behind these tools in the standard, shows universal methods based on pattern search to process the information in the tools to make decisions, and presents some adaptation use cases where these tools can be used.},

In this paper we focus on packet-timescale rate adaptation (PTRA) techniques, which apply to individual traffic processing chips in the circuit packs of network systems. We look at the available options for PTRA implementation and compare their performance in realistic multi-device configurations. We find that in linear multi-device topologies the sleep-state-exploitation (SSE) scheme, which only adds a sleep state to the ordinary full-capacity state, offers the best compromise between energy savings and the unavoidable packet delay degradation of PTRA.},

of both rate-controlled and non-rate-controlled segments. A common
example of such an environment occurs when the end systems are part of
IP datagram networks interconnected by a rate-controlled segment, such
as an ATM network using the ABR service. In the absence of congestive
losses in either segment, the TCP keeps increasing its window to its
maximum size. Mismatch between the TCP window and the bandwidth-delay
product of the network will result in an accumulation of large queues
and possibly buffer overflows in the devices at the edges of the
rate-controlled segment, causing degraded throughput and unfairness. We
develop an explicit feedback scheme, called explicit window adaptation
based on modifying the receiver's advertised window in the TCP
acknowledgments returning to the source. The window size indicated to
the TCP is a function of the free buffer in the edge device. Results
from simulations with a wide range of traffic scenarios show that this
explicit window adaptation scheme can control the buffer occupancy
efficiently at the edge device, and results in significant improvements
in packet loss rate, fairness, and throughput over a packet discard

abstract = {Rate adaptation is critical to the system performance of wireless networks. Typically, rate adaptation is considered as a MAC layer mechanism in IEEE 802.11. Most previous work relies only on frame losses to infer channel quality, but performs poorly if frame losses are mainly caused by interference. Recently SNR- based rate adaptation schemes have been proposed, but most of them have not been studied in a real environment. In this paper, we first conduct a systematic measurement-based study to confirm that in general SNR is a good prediction tool for channel quality, and identify two key challenges for this to be used in practice: (1) The SNR measures in hardware are often uncalibrated, and thus the SNR thresholds are hardware dependent. (2) The direct prediction from SNR to frame delivery ratio (FDR) is often over optimistic under interference conditions. Based on these observations, we present a novel practical SNR- Guided Rate Adaptation (SGRA) scheme. We implement and evaluate SGRA in a real test-bed and compare it with other three algorithms: ARF, RRAA and HRC. Our results show that SGRA outperforms the other three algorithms in all cases we have tested.},

abstract = {Modern video players today rely on bit-rate adaptation in order to respond to changing network conditions. Past measurement studies have identified issues with today's commercial players when multiple bit-rate-adaptive players share a bottleneck link with respect to three metrics: fairness, efficiency, and stability. Unfortunately, our current understanding of why these effects occur and how they can be mitigated is quite limited. In this paper, we present a principled understanding of bit-rate adaptation and analyze several commercial players through the lens of an abstract player model consisting of three main components: bandwidth estimation, bit-rate selection, and chunk scheduling. Using framework, we identify the root causes of several undesirable interactions that arise as a consequence of overlaying the video bit-rate adaptation over HTTP. Building on these insights, we develop a suite of techniques that can systematically guide the tradeoffs between stability, fairness, and efficiency and thus lead to a general framework for robust video adaptation. We pick one concrete instance from this design space and show that it significantly outperforms today's commercial players on all three key metrics across a range of experimental scenarios.},

abstract = {IEEE 802.11-based devices employ rate adaptation algorithms to dynamically switch data rates to accommodate the fluctuating wireless channel conditions. Many studies observed that when there are other stations transmitting in the network, existing rate adaptation performance degrades significantly due to its inability to differentiate losses between wireless noise and contention collisions. In this paper, we first conduct a systematic evaluation on the effectiveness of various rate adaptation protocols, which try to address this issue by exploiting optional RTS frames to isolate the wireless losses from collision losses. We observe that these existing schemes do not perform well in many background traffic scenarios and can mislead the rate adaptation algorithms to persist on using similar data rate combinations regardless of background traffic level, thus resulting in performance penalty in certain scenarios. The fundamental challenge is to dynamically adjust the rate selection decision objectives with respect to different background traffic levels, as well as fluctuating wireless conditions. In light of such observations, we design a new Background traffic-aWAre RatE adaptation algorithm (BEWARE) that addresses the above challenge. BEWARE uses a mathematical model to calculate on the fly the expected packet transmission time based on current wireless channel and background traffic conditions. We implement BEWARE design in a Linux-based driver, and the test-bed experiment results show that BEWARE outperforms other rate adaptation algorithms by up to 250\% in various indoor and outdoor scenarios.},

Another key finding is that a mechanism effective in differentiating between collision and fading losses for hidden terminals has severely imbalanced throughput sharing when competing links are even slightly heterogeneous.

abstract = {Many computations exhibit a trade off between execution time and quality of service. A video encoder, for example, can often encode frames more quickly if it is given the freedom to produce slightly lower quality video. A developer attempting to optimize such computations must navigate a complex trade-off space to find optimizations that appropriately balance quality of service and performance. We present a new quality of service profiler that is designed to help developers identify promising optimization opportunities in such computations. In contrast to standard profilers, which simply identify time-consuming parts of the computation, a quality of service profiler is designed to identify subcomputations that can be replaced with new (and potentially less accurate) subcomputations that deliver significantly increased performance in return for acceptably small quality of service losses. Our quality of service profiler uses loop perforation (which transforms loops to perform fewer iterations than the original loop) to obtain implementations that occupy different points in the performance/quality of service trade-off space. The rationale is that optimizable computations often contain loops that perform extra iterations, and that removing iterations, then observing the resulting effect on the quality of service, is an effective way to identify such optimizable subcomputations. Our experimental results from applying our implemented quality of service profiler to a challenging set of benchmark applications show that it can enable developers to identify promising optimization opportunities and deliver successful optimizations that substantially increase the performance with only small quality of service losses.},

service (QoS) requirements across networks when the information
available for making routing decisions is inaccurate. Such uncertainty
about the actual state of a network component arises naturally in a
number of different environments. The goal of the route selection
process is then to identify a path that is most likely to satisfy the
QoS requirements. For end-to-end delay guarantees, this problem is
intractable. However, we show that by decomposing the end-to-end

end-to-end constraint into local constraints for a given path. We show
that, for general distributions, this problem is also intractable.
Nonetheless, by defining a certain class of probability distributions,
which includes typical distributions, and restricting ourselves to that
class, we are able to establish efficient and exact solutions. We then
consider the general problem of combined path optimization and delay

abstract = {Emerging applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) require real-time quality of service (QoS) guarantees to be provided by the network. However, designing real-time scheduling and communication solutions for these networks is challenging since the characteristics of QoS metrics in WSNs are not well known yet. Due to the nature of wireless connectivity, it is infeasible to satisfy worst-case QoS requirements in WSNs. Instead, probabilistic QoS guarantees should be provided, which requires the definition of probabilistic QoS metrics. To provide an analytical tool for the development of real-time solutions, in this paper, the distribution of end-to-end delay in multi-hop WSNs is investigated. Accordingly, a comprehensive and accurate cross-layer analysis framework, which employs a stochastic queueing model in realistic channel environments, is developed. This framework captures the heterogeneity in WSNs in terms of channel quality, transmit power, queue length, and communication protocols. A case study with the TinyOS CSMA/CA MAC protocol is conducted to show how the developed framework can analytically predict the distribution of end-to-end delay. Testbed experiments are provided to validate the developed model. The cross-layer framework can be used to identify the relationships between network parameters and the distribution of end-to-end delay and accordingly, to design real-time solutions for WSNs. Our ongoing work suggests that this framework can be easily extended to model additional QoS metrics such as energy consumption distribution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate probabilistic QoS guarantees in WSNs.},

As computer and communication technology evolves, distributed multimedia applications are becoming ubiquitous, and quality of service (QoS) is becoming ever more integral to those applications. Because they consume so many resources (such as memory and bandwidth), multimedia applications need resource management at different layers of the communications protocol stack to ensure end-to-end service quality, and to regulate resource contention for equitable resource sharing. However, before an application can invoke any QoS-aware resource management mechanisms and policies - such as admission control, resource reservation, enforcement, and adaptation - it must specify its QoS requirements and the corresponding resource allocations. Furthermore, the application must describe how QoS should be scaled and adapted in cases of resource contention or resource scarcity during runtime. Our goal in this article is to systematically classify and compare the existing QoS specification languages that span several QoS layers with diverse properties. The provided taxonomy and the extensive analysis will give us a detailed look at the existing QoS specification languages along with their properties and relations.},

The "bearer" is a central element of the EPS QoS concept and is the level of granularity for bearer-level QoS control. The network-initiated QoS control paradigm specified in EPS is a set of signaling procedures for managing bearers and controlling their QoS assigned by the network. The EPS QoS concept is class-based, where each bearer is assigned one and only one QoS class identifier by the network. The QCI is a scalar that is used within the access network as a reference to node-specific parameters that control packet forwarding treatment. This class-based approach, together with the network-initiated QoS control paradigm, gives network operators full control over the QoS provided for its offered services for each of its subscriber groups.},

abstract = {Satellite communications are characterized by long delays, packet losses, and sometimes intermittent connectivity and link disruptions. The TCP/IP stack is ineffective against these impairments and even dedicated solutions, such as performance enhancing proxies (PEPs), can hardly tackle the most challenging environments, and create compatibility issues with current security protocols. An alternative solution arises from the delay- and disruption-tolerant networking (DTN) architecture, which specifies an overlay protocol, called bundle protocol (BP), on top of either transport protocols (TCP, UDP, etc.), or of lower layer protocols (Bluetooth, Ethernet, etc.). The DTN architecture provides long-term information storage on intermediate nodes, suitable for coping with disrupted links, long delays, and intermittent connectivity. By dividing the end-to-end path into multiple DTN hops, in a way that actually extends the TCP-splitting concept exploited in most PEPs, DTN allows the use of specialized protocols on the satellite (or space) links. This paper discusses the prospects for use of DTN in future satellite networks. We present a broad DTN overview, to make the reader familiar with the characteristics that differentiate DTN from ordinary TCP/IP networking, compare the DTN and PEP architectures and stacks, as a preliminary step for the subsequent DTN performance assessment carried out in practical LEO/GEO satellite scenarios. DTN security is studied next, examining the advantages over present satellite architectures, the threats faced in satellite scenarios, and also open issues. Finally, the relation between DTN and quality of service (QoS) is investigated, by focusing on QoS architectures and QoS tools and by discussing the state of the art of DTN research activity in modeling, routing, and congestion control.},

Based on this framework, virtual network subscribers are provided with a service that is most suitable with their tolerability to utilize the soft-guaranteed bandwidths. This helps to save the cost of subscribers and to increase the profitability of the provider.

abstract = {The current shift from the static access based service model to the dynamic application based service model introduced major challenges for effective forensics of any quality degradation of the provided service. In addition, about 55 percent of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 providers are planning to offer managed security services to guarantee an attack free IP service. In this article, we propose a novel approach of modeling the network behavior in order to select meaningful metrics to be used in tracking the network behavior changes. Based on the deftly selected metrics, we utilize an adaptive exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) with a moving centerline control chart to monitor the changes of the network behavior. Signaling the network behavior changes in association with the service objective based network behavioral model should provide the required information for effective forensic of the service quality degradation. Our methodology is applied on both simulated and real traces of network behavioral metrics. We illustrate the effectiveness of the forensic analysis model for the selection of relevant behavioral metrics. As well, we show how the adaptive EWMA can be used for tracking the changes in the network behavior from normal to abnormal and vice versa.},

@article{Klein2012,
abstract = {Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) enables the composition of loosely coupled services provided with varying Quality of Service (QoS) levels. Selecting a (near-)optimal set of services for a composition in terms of QoS is crucial when many functionally equivalent services are available. With the advent of Cloud Computing, both the number of such services and their distribution across the network are rising rapidly, increasing the impact of the network on the QoS of such compositions. Despite this, current approaches do not differentiate between the QoS of services themselves and the QoS of the network. Therefore, the computed latency differs substantially from the actual latency, resulting in suboptimal QoS for service compositions in the cloud. Thus, we propose a network-aware approach that handles the QoS of services and the QoS of the network independently. First, we build a network model in order to estimate the network latency between arbitrary services and potential users. Our selection algorithm then leverages this model to find compositions that will result in a low latency given an employed execution policy. In our evaluation, we show that our approach eficiently computes compositions with much lower latency than current approaches.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor/actuator networks (WSANs) are emerging rapidly as a new generation of sensor networks. Despite intensive research in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), limited work has been found in the open literature in the field of WSANs. In particular, quality-of-service (QoS) management in WSANs remains an important issue yet to be investigated. As an attempt in this direction, this paper develops a fuzzy logic control based QoS management (FLC-QM) scheme for WSANs with constrained resources and in dynamic and unpredictable environments. Taking advantage of the feedback control technology, this scheme deals with the impact of unpredictable changes in traffic load on the QoS of WSANs. It utilizes a fuzzy logic controller inside each source sensor node to adapt sampling period to the deadline miss ratio associated with data transmission from the sensor to the actuator. The deadline miss ratio is maintained at a pre-determined desired level so that the required QoS can be achieved. The FLC-QM has the advantages of generality, scalability, and simplicity. Simulation results show that the FLC-QM can provide WSANs with QoS support.},

abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are embracing an increasing number of real-time applications subject to strict delay constraints. Utilizing the methodology of potential field in physics, in this article we effectively address the challenges of real-time routing in WSNs. In particular, based on a virtual composite potential field, we propose the Potential-based Real-Time Routing (PRTR) protocol that supports real-time routing using multipath transmission. PRTR minimizes delay for real-time traffic and alleviates possible congestions simultaneously. Since the delay bounds of real-time flows are extremely important, the end-to-end delay bound for a single flow is derived based on the Network Calculus theory. The simulation results show that PRTR minimizes the end-to-end delay for real-time routing, and also guarantees a tight bound on the delay.},

design for real-time systems is presented. A system is defined by a
conventional mathematical model for a dynamic system where application
specific states denote functions of real time. Specifications are
formulas in duration calculus, a real-time interval logic, where
predicates define durations of states. Requirements define safety and
functionality constraints on the system or a component. A top-level
design is given by a control law: a predicate that defines an automation
controlling the transition between phases of operation. Each phase
maintains certain relations among the system states; this is analogous
to the control functions known from conventional control theory. The
top-level design is decomposed into an architecture for a distributed
system with specifications for sensor, actuator, and program components.
Programs control the distributed computation through synchronous events.
Sensors and actuators relate events with system states. Verification is
a deduction showing that a design implies requirements},

In the paper ,we gained the real-time arrives curve and other service parameters through the network calculus of the typical model of the network data stream. Then, we calculate the the largest network delay, the largest service time. According to the results of network calculus, we developed a services curve-based strategy for the queue and set up a subsection control model to resolve the rate wobling and other issues in industrial Ethernet, thus ensuring stability of information transmission in the real-time control network. Finally, simulate the algorithm with the NS2 in linux, and analysis of the results to verify its basic performance of real-time transmission and the rate stability.},

In this paper, we study optimal rate control to minimize transmission energy expenditure subject to strict deadline or other quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Specifically, the system consists of a wireless transmitter with controllable transmission rate and with strict QoS constraints on data transmission. The goal is to obtain a rate-control policy that minimizes the total transmission energy expenditure while ensuring that the QoS constraints are met. Using a novel formulation based on cumulative curves methodology, we obtain the optimal transmission policy and show that it has a simple and appealing graphical visualization. Utilizing the optimal ldquoofflinerdquo results, we then develop an online transmission policy for an arbitrary stream of packet arrivals and deadline constraints, and show, via simulations, that it is significantly more energy-efficient than a simple head-of-line drain policy. Finally, we generalize the optimal policy results to the case of time-varying power-rate functions.},

However, an increasing number of scenarios where sensor networks are considered for time-critical purposes in application scenarios like intrusion detection, industrial monitoring, or health care systems demands for an explicit support of performance guarantees in WSNs and, thus, in turn for a respective mathematical framework. In (J. Schmitt and U. Roedig, 2005) , a sensor network calculus was introduced in order to accommodate a worst-case analysis of WSNs. This sensor network calculus focused on the communication aspect in WSNs, but had not yet a possibility to treat in-network processing in WSNs. In this work, we now incorporate in-network processing features as they are typical for WSNs by taking into account computational resources on the sensor nodes. Furthermore, we propose a simple, yet effective priority queue management discipline which achieves a good balance of response times across sensor nodes in the field.},

abstract = {This document defines an architecture for implementing$\backslash$nscalable service differentiation in the Internet. This architecture$\backslash$nachieves scalability by aggregating traffic classification state which$\backslash$nis conveyed by means of IP-layer packet marking using the DS field$\backslash$n[DSFIELD]. Packets are classified and marked to receive a particular$\backslash$nper-hop forwarding behavior on nodes along their path. Sophisticated$\backslash$nclassification, marking, policing, and shaping operations need only be$\backslash$nimplemented at network boundaries or hosts. Network resources are$\backslash$nallocated to traffic streams by service provisioning policies which$\backslash$ngovern how traffic is marked and conditioned upon entry to a$\backslash$ndifferentiated services-capable network, and how that traffic is$\backslash$nforwarded within that network. A wide variety of services can be$\backslash$nimplemented on top of these building blocks.},

  abstract = {As the bandwidth of CPUs and networks continues to grow, it becomes
	more attractive, for efficiency reasons, to share such resources
	among several applications with the minimum level of interference.
	This can be achieved using temporal partitions, with each application
	assigned to its own partition and executing as if it was executing
	alone on a resource with lower bandwidth. The partitions are associated
	to servers that execute the application tasks according to a given
	application-level scheduler. On the other hand, the set of servers
	is scheduled by a system-level scheduler. This paper addresses the
	particular case of fixed priorities-based application-level schedulers
	together with a periodic server model at the system level. It starts
	with an adequate response time analysis based on the notion of server
	availability for a known server. Then it addresses the inverse problem
	of designing a server with minimum system-level resource requirements
	to fulfill the application time constraints. In this context, the
	paper shows that response time based schedulability tests with linear
	time bounds do not need to consider all tasks but just a small subset,
	which may lead to substantial speed-ups. The proposed method goes
	a step further with respect to other recent works in the literature
	by considering a more complete task model, effectively computing
	the server parameters and establishing a better trade-off concerning
	complexity and tightness.},

	verification do cover a lot of ground in improving and ensuring high
	reliability, they may not cover all possible fault scenarios that
	a system could encounter at runtime. Thus, runtime 'health management'
	of complex embedded software systems is required to improve their
	dependability. Our approach to Software Health Management uses concepts
	from the field of `Systems Health Management': detection, diagnosis
	and mitigation. While our earlier work focused on a reactive mitigation
	strategy specified using a timed state machine model, this paper
	describes a deliberative mitigation engine that relies on a function-allocation
	model to identify alternative component-assembly configurations that
	can restore the functions needed for the goals of the system.},

	Partition configuration constraints for real-time tasks include affinity

	arbitrary partition schedulers, harmonic partition execution, and
	round robin partition execution (which is particularly problematic).
	Our interest is in minimizing end-to-end latency, though the computational
	complexity of the problem

	prevents us from finding optimal results. We conclude with some open

abstract ={This paper presents a component-based modelling approach to
                  system-software co-engineering of real-time embedded systems,
                  in particular aerospace systems. Our method is centred around
                  the standardized Architecture Analysis and Design Language
                  (AADL) modelling framework. We formalize a significant subset
                  of AADL, incorporating its recent Error Model Annex for
                  modelling faults and repairs. The major distinguishing
                  aspects of this component-based approach are the possibility
                  to describe nominal hardware and software operations, hybrid
                  (and timing) aspects, as well as probabilistic faults and
                  their propagation and recovery. Moreover, it supports dynamic
                  (i.e. on-the-fly) reconfiguration of components and
                  inter-component connections. The operational semantics gives
                  a precise interpretation of specifications by providing a
                  mapping onto networks of event-data automata. These networks
                  are then subject to different kinds of formal analysis such
                  as model checking, safety and dependability analysis and
                  performance evaluation. Mature tool support realizes these
                  analyses. The activities reported in this paper are carried
                  out in the context of the correctness, modelling, and
                  performance of aerospace systems, project which is funded by
                  the European Space Agency.},

    Abstract = {We describe a programming model called PTIDES (Programming Temporally Integrated Distributed Embedded Systems), that extends the discrete-event model of computation with a carefully chosen relationship between real time and model time. PTIDES provides a framework for exploring a family of execution strategies for distributed embedded systems. Our objective in this paper is to present an execution strategy that 1) allows independent events to be processed out of time stamp order, 2) uses clock synchronization as a replacement for null message communication across distributed platforms, 3) defines a notion of when events are safe to process and 4) presents an implementation of a PTIDES model. This work puts forward an execution strategy that is aggressive in concurrent execution of events.}
