\label{ch:tasks}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Run-Time/Dynamic Updates and reevaluation
	\begin{itemize}
		\item How to adapt model data for reevaluation at run-time
		\item What information needs to be changed about the model
		\item What information comes from the run-time system
	\end{itemize}
	\item Traffic classes
	\begin{itemize}
		\item TDMA, Time-Triggered, Rate-Constrained, Best-Effort, Critical
		\item Modeling/Analysis using my framework (vs. others)
		\item Run-time system
	\end{itemize}
	\item Adaptation:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Modeling of adaptable systems
		\item Modeling of adaptable applications
		\item Interaction between adaptable application and system
		\begin{itemize}
			\item e.g. changing traffic classes at run-time
			\item System degrades => apps meter their production => extra bandwidth despite degradation => some apps can request more bandwidth
		\end{itemize}
		\item Traffic class-based adaptation
		\item Verification
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Design-time/Static based on models
			\item Run-time/Dynamic based on models and current data
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\item Network QoS Profile generation from Business Logic
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Data-driven application profiles?
		\item Return-path profiles?
		\item Adaptation architecture integrated into business logic language?
	\end{itemize}
	\item ROS component model
	\begin{itemize}
		\item simple metamodel
		\item analysis integrated into modeling tools
		\item structured development and code generation
	\end{itemize}
	\item ROS implementation
	\begin{itemize}
		\item component model implementation : component message queues with priority
		\item network QoS enforcement and arbitration in ROS (with traffic classes?)
		\item fractionated roscore
		\item better failure recovery for connected components
		\item better migration of components
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
