\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{ch:conclusions}

We have described in this proposal the what aspects of Cyber-Physical
Systems(CPS) analysis, design, development, and integration we are
addressing.  We have provided descriptions of the relevant related
work in this area, covering both the design-time modeling, analysis,
and performance prediction for networked, distributed, CPS
applications and the run-time monitoring and management of application
and CPS network resources.

Subsequently, the completed research towards precise network
performance prediction, \shorttool/, was presented.  We showed how
different aspects of applications and systems could be analyzed,
culminating in the composition of multiple applications in a
distributed, statically routed system configuration.

Run-time network monitoring and anomaly detection mechanisms were
presented which used the modeling semantics from the design-time
techniques and showed how such models could be used for ensuring
quality of service (QoS) at run-time for distributed, networked
systems.

Finally, some areas of future work were presented which would extend
the capabilities of our techniques and would increase the domain over
which our analysis would be applicable.
