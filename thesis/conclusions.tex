\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{ch:conclusions}

We have described in this proposal the what aspects of Cyber-Physical
Systems(CPS) analysis, design, development, and integration we are
addressing.  We have provided descriptions of the relevant related
work in this area, covering both the design-time modeling, analysis,
and performance prediction for networked, distributed, CPS
applications and the run-time monitoring and management of application
and CPS network resources.  The subsequent chapters described the work
that has been done thus far regarding both design-time modeling and
analysis and run-time monitoring and management.  The remaining
challenges within the scope of this research have been explained in
their respective chapters, describing the remaining work to extend the
modeling and analysis techniques for more precise resource modeling
and more relevant system modeling, and describing the remaining work
to extend the run-time management to categorize and classify detected
anomalies.
