- 4.2 has the same problem - it reads like a superficial summary. You
  are doing a disservice to your own work if you don't explain it
  well, so I suggest to expand this, and explain it better.

DONE:
-----

- obviously you need a better quality figure 8, and/or a
  reference. You may be able to generate it yourself using Matlab, but
  in that case you will have to give some references. SFFMT 2013
  should have some refs for sat cluster orbits.

- 3.5: I thought differentiation and integration are linear operators,
  so why do you have to do this on the derivatives?

- do you have a spell checker? use it. Calclulus ? 

- tc description: for the uninitated this is hard to understand. It
  either has to be expanded with more details, or a more abstract, yet
  more understandable summary has to be written up. Try to use a
  queuing system diagram, or a signal flow diagram to illustrate the
  different actions in the different layers. And avoid the use of
  Linux-specific acronyms. Nobody knows what a qdisc is.

- I would like to see the structure of the table for the routing
  problem (if not the actual numbers).

- clean up the references (bibtex) ... ... ...

- saying only that results have been reported already (e.g. 3.1.3)
  does disservice to your own work. I suggest to reuse text from the
  paper in the thesis and report it again.

- Don't start a chapter with a figure. 4.1 Also, some of this chapter
  reads like a powerpoint slide. It should read like a thesis - you
  need to clearly communicate.
