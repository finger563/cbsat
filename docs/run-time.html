<h2>Middleware-integrated Measurement, Detection, and Enforcement<a class="headerlink" href="#middleware-integrated-measurement-detection-and-enforcement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We have implemented these features based on our design-time results:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Traffic generators according to profile generated into sender code</li>
<li>Receiver service according to profile generated into receiver code</li>
<li>Measurement of output traffic on sender side and input traffic on
server side generated into code</li>
<li>Detection of anomalous sending on sender side</li>
<li>Mitigation of anoumalous sending on sender side</li>
<li>Detection of anomalous sending on receiver side</li>
<li>Push back to sender middleware through out-of-band channel for
anomaly detection on server side</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these functions uses the same profiles which enable
design-time system and application analysis.  This integration not
only helps with running experiments and data collection but also helps
to ensure model to system consistency.</p>
<p>We have implemented profile-based traffic generators and traffic
measurement into our code generators that we use with our model-driven
design software.  We developed this toolsuite to create distributed
component-based software which uses ROS as the communications
middleware.  For publish/subscribe interactions between components,
into the generated code we add generic traffic generators which read
their associated profile from the deployment XML file and publish
traffic on their publisher port according to that profile.
Additionally, these publish operations are generated to use a small
wrapper which can measure the publish rate and can decide to throw a
<em>profile exceeded</em> exception if the application attempts to send too
much data or if the receiver has pushed back to the sender informing
it to stop.</p>
<p>This push back from the receiver occurs through the use of an
out-of-band (OOB) channel using UDP multicast, which receivers use to
inform specific senders that they are sending too much data to the
receivers (and possibly overflowing the receiver buffers).  This OOB
channel provides a mechanism by which the secure middleware layer can
protect the system from malicious or faulty applications.</p>
<p>Into the receiver code (for subscribers) we additionally generate a
receive buffer and receiver thread which reads the receiver profile
from the deployment XML file and pulls data from the buffer according
to the profile.  In this scenario, the receiver has a capacity with
which it can handle incoming data, and it has a finite buffer so it
must use the OOB channel and measurements on the incoming data stream
to determine which senders to shut down to ensure its buffer does not
overflow.  When the buffer has had some time empty (so that it&#8217;s not
in danger of running out of buffer space), the receiver can use the
OOB channel to inform the halted senders that it is alright to send
again.</p>

<p>Our original implementation of traffic generators performed
better since they did not utilize a middleware layer and
relied instead on simple point to point ipv6 connections.
However, that code was less useful for system analysis
because it could do nothing aside from traffic generation
and measurement; our current implementation which generates
traffic generation code into component code is more
versatile for several reasons:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>The component-based code integrates directly into our development
toolsuite and deployment framework so it can be easily deployed on
our cluster.</li>
<li>Configuring different system topologies or component to host
mappings (deployments) is simpler and more robust, allowing us to
perform more and more varied experiments.</li>
<li>The traffic generation code can be removed (or the code can be
regenerated without the option selected) and the rest of the
component-based and middleware code is still useful as an actual
application.</li>

<h2>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Detection<a class="headerlink" href="#distributed-denial-of-service-ddos-detection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>DDoS attacks can take many forms, but are generally classified as
excessive traffic from a large amount of (possibly heterogeneous)
sources targeted towards a single point or a single group.  Such
attacks are common to machines on the internet, but can also become a
hazard for machines on private networks which become infected or
inadvertently expose a path for data traversal.</p>
<p>These private or semi-private systems must have mechanisms for
detecting and mitigating such attacks, and the combination of our
design-time analysis and run-time measurement, detection, and
mitigation tools provides such capability.</p>
<p>If we relax the constraint from the design-time section that all
sender profiles are absolute and the system behavior is completely
known at design-time, then we not only expand the scope of
applications that can be supported but also enable meaningful anomaly
detection.  Instead of treating the application profiles as the exact
amount of data that the applications need to send, we assume they are
the mean amount of data that the application will need to send over
each respective interval.  Additionally, we add an upper curve to the
application profiles which is the guaranteed maximum that the
application will ever try to send in each respective period.</p>
<p>For system analysis, we perform the design-time analysis on both the
mean-data curve and the max-data curve which each give predicted
buffer space requirements for the senders and receivers. Since buffer
space on many of these systems comes at a premium, we cannot always
take the maximum buffer size from this calculation as our
implementation. For the senders, we are free to choose the allocated
buffer space in the deployed system within this range as we see fit,
since the senders have a large degree (or full) control over the
sender rate and can meter themselves to not lose data.  However, for
the receivers, we can select a buffer size within the mean-max range
based on our total system capacity and then rely on the measurement,
detection, and mitigation code to ensure that we do not lose data due
to buffer overflowing.</p>
<p>In this scenario, the receiver has been given knowledge of all of the
sender profiles which might transmit data to it.  When the receiver
detects that the buffer is filling up quickly enough to overflow the
buffer in the near future, it can use the measurements that have been
gathered about the received traffic up to this point to determine
which sender components to throttle temporarily.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Figure 2: The nodes in the network and how they communicate (using pub/sub).</span></p>
</div>
<p>We shown experimentally that, for example, a server side buffer size
of 400000 bits, which would normally grow to 459424 bits because of
excessive data pumps on the sender sides, is kept to 393792 by
utilizing this out-of-band channel and secure middleware.</p>
