</div>
<p>Our run-time research and development of measurement, detection, and
enforcement code for networked applications is built on the foundation
of component-based software engineering (CBSE).  The goal of CBSE is
to provide a reusable framework for the development of application
building-blocks, called <em>components</em> so that developers can develop
and <em>analyze</em> applications in a more robust and scalable manner.  In
CBSE, a <em>component</em>, shown schematically in <a class="pageref" href="#fig-component">Figure  1</a>, is the smallest deployable part of an application and
is defined as:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><img src="_images/math/40611739391a1c17b6ec459e52482c7322d20809.png" alt="C = \{\{T\},\{P\},H\}"/></p>
</div><p>Where</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><img class="math" src="_images/math/71676f7f49d77829c48f5d2218113e8ebe7a1017.png" alt="\{T\}"/> is the <em>set</em> of all <em>timers</em> within the component.  A
timer provides a periodic event trigger to the component which
triggers the callback associated with <img class="math" src="_images/math/6d42c88506b8da39a2a23653aecbfb7c29728063.png" alt="T"/>.</li>
<li><img class="math" src="_images/math/65d6b17699350b738003572a33a80c618658bf7e.png" alt="\{P\}"/> is the <em>set</em> of all <em>input/output ports</em> within the
component.  An i/o port provides a mechanism for message passing and
event triggering between components, and may take the form of
asynchronous <em>publish/subscribe</em> or synchronous <em>client/server</em>
interaction patterns.  Similarly to timers, each incoming event
triggers the callback associated with <img class="math" src="_images/math/f48b617185733d8dd6712643f1ab17c736661a06.png" alt="P"/>.</li>
<li><img class="math" src="_images/math/48f75e0b463f2fdb7fca9566cffdc439cae6967f.png" alt="H"/> is the single thread which executes all event events for
the component, in FIFO order, without preemption.</li>
</ul>
<p>From this component definition, we can define an application as:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><img src="_images/math/2124f9728e0724286a9335990c9fefae9f0c3155.png" alt="A = \{\{C\},\{M\}\}"/></p>
</div><p>Where</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><img class="math" src="_images/math/37b36d1290f8dff33b593bab466813939fbfcc95.png" alt="\{C\}"/> is the <em>set</em> of components in the application</li>
<li><img class="math" src="_images/math/7b41fd5fb50c9e53f0e5bea049144017ca7726e4.png" alt="\{M\}"/> is the <em>set</em> of <em>mappings</em> between ports of the
components in <img class="math" src="_images/math/37b36d1290f8dff33b593bab466813939fbfcc95.png" alt="\{C\}"/>, for instance connecting a subscriber of
<img class="math" src="_images/math/eb06e2d848c46b5ebd3c7c71d2a0c4c77d571023.png" alt="C_x"/> to a publisher of <img class="math" src="_images/math/39a8ec6d3eff4f14d2414d8091b3015d8d3d0969.png" alt="C_y"/>, <img class="math" src="_images/math/e9fd93b1230ec487f927850c88e903aa52723a47.png" alt="M_{x,y} :
C_x\{P_S\}\mapsto C_y\{P_P\}"/>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, an application&#8217;s components are grouped into processes
and distributed onto the nodes of a system through a deployment
defined as:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><img src="_images/math/bd1acc1ff13c5fec38e58e23b1d45faae7926a4e.png" alt="D = \{\{N\},\{U\},\{M\}\}"/></p>
</div><p>Where</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><img class="math" src="_images/math/965f1d1188ca407fa91a1324b28e9ccbfad460e5.png" alt="\{N\}"/> is the <em>set</em> of hardware <em>nodes</em> in the system</li>
<li><img class="math" src="_images/math/eaf2c6be2cbfcd7e5236de248087e34b9da6aa83.png" alt="\{U\}"/> is the <em>set</em> of <em>processes</em> defining the deployment,
where a process is a collection of components
<img class="math" src="_images/math/14282023fb6c5d867d6470bb0bb6b2b0f4826e5b.png" alt="U=\{C\}\subseteq A\{\{C\}\}"/>.</li>
<li><img class="math" src="_images/math/7b41fd5fb50c9e53f0e5bea049144017ca7726e4.png" alt="\{M\}"/> is the <em>set</em> of <em>mappings</em> between processes and nodes
in the system, e.g. <img class="math" src="_images/math/0642ec897e463735bb62c269e2bac8fea2d86bc4.png" alt="M_{U_1,N_1} : U_1\mapsto N_1"/>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note here that though the components may be single threaded
internally, the application containing these components may run them
in parallel, e.g. by grouping them into a process or distributing them
among the hardware nodes of the system.  An example application and
deployment onto a system of nodes is shown in <a class="pageref" href="#fig-cbse">Figure  2</a>.
Note that multiple applications (shades of blue in this figure) may be
deployed simultaneously onto the same system and may even interact
with each other.</p>

<p>We have implemented these features based on our design-time results:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Traffic generators according to profile generated into sender code</li>
<li>Receiver service according to profile generated into receiver code</li>
<li>Measurement of output traffic on sender side and input traffic on
server side generated into code</li>
<li>Detection of anomalous sending on sender side</li>
<li>Mitigation of anoumalous sending on sender side</li>
<li>Detection of anomalous sending on receiver side</li>
<li>Push back to sender middleware through out-of-band channel for
anomaly detection on server side</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these functions uses the same profiles which enable
design-time system and application analysis.  This integration not
only helps with running experiments and data collection but also helps
to ensure model to system consistency.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Figure 3: The structure of component-based applications and how their network

</div>
<p>We have implemented profile-based traffic generators and traffic
measurement into our code generators that we use with our model-driven
design software.  We developed this toolsuite to create distributed
component-based software which uses ROS as the communications
middleware.  For publish/subscribe interactions between components,
into the generated code we add generic traffic generators which read
their associated profile from the deployment XML file and publish
traffic on their publisher port according to that profile.
Additionally, these publish operations are generated to use a small
wrapper which can measure the publish rate and can decide to throw a
<em>profile exceeded</em> exception if the application attempts to send too
much data or if the receiver has pushed back to the sender informing
it to stop.  The sender-side middleware layer is shown in <a class="pageref" href="#fig-sender">Figure  3</a>.</p>
<p>This push back from the receiver occurs through the use of an
out-of-band (OOB) channel using UDP multicast, which receivers use to
inform specific senders that they are sending too much data to the
receivers (and possibly overflowing the receiver buffers).  This OOB
channel provides a mechanism by which the secure middleware layer can
protect the system from malicious or faulty applications.</p>
<p>Into the receiver code (for subscribers) we additionally generate a
receive buffer and receiver thread which reads the receiver profile
from the deployment XML file and pulls data from the buffer according
to the profile.  In this scenario, the receiver has a capacity with
which it can handle incoming data, and it has a finite buffer so it
must use the OOB channel and measurements on the incoming data stream
to determine which senders to shut down to ensure its buffer does not
overflow.  When the buffer has had some time empty (so that it&#8217;s not
in danger of running out of buffer space), the receiver can use the
OOB channel to inform the halted senders that it is alright to send
again.</p>

<p>Our original implementation of traffic generators performed
better since they did not utilize a middleware layer and
relied instead on simple point to point ipv6 connections.
However, that code was less useful for system analysis
because it could do nothing aside from traffic generation
and measurement; our current implementation which generates
traffic generation code into component code is more
versatile for several reasons:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>The component-based code integrates directly into our development
toolsuite and deployment framework so it can be easily deployed on
our cluster.</li>
<li>Configuring different system topologies or component to host
mappings (deployments) is simpler and more robust, allowing us to
perform more and more varied experiments.</li>
<li>The traffic generation code can be removed (or the code can be
regenerated without the option selected) and the rest of the
component-based and middleware code is still useful as an actual
application.</li>

<h2>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Detection<a class="headerlink" href="#distributed-denial-of-service-ddos-detection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Denial-of-Service (DoS) [<a class="reference internal" href="#rfc4732">RFC4732</a>] and Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks
can take many forms, but are generally classified as excessive traffic
from a large amount of (possibly heterogeneous) sources targeted
towards a single point or a single group.  Such attacks are common to
machines on the internet, but can also become a hazard for machines on
private networks which become infected or inadvertently expose an
input path for external malicious data.</p>
<p>These private or semi-private systems must have mechanisms for
detecting and mitigating such attacks, and the combination of our
design-time analysis and run-time measurement, detection, and
mitigation tools provides a form for such capability.  The goal of
this work is for a receiver, which is being targeted for attack by a
set of senders, to determine which of the senders are behaving
anomalously and prevent them from sending any more data.  In this way,
a group of senders performing a DDoS attack can be mitigated by the
targeted receiver.  Towards this goal we make the following changes
outlined below to our modeling/analysis framework and implementation.</p>
<p>If we relax the constraint from the design-time section that all
sender profiles are absolute and the system behavior is completely
known at design-time, then we not only expand the scope of
applications that can be supported but also enable meaningful anomaly
detection.</p>
<p>Whereas previously, profiles captured in their definition the
<img class="math" src="_images/math/87c2faaa595684b1a0ec3c5a6fee140ce3220be9.png" alt="data\ rate"/> as a function of time that the application
produced, we now alter the definition to capture two parameters:
<img class="math" src="_images/math/cdd559c7ae38bd6a6ca2539bb98a6f493e1fc06e.png" alt="mean\ data\ rate"/> (<img class="math" src="_images/math/2e6c76553063a94d2e1a8d12e23a6228b3b14ad5.png" alt="mDR"/>) and <img class="math" src="_images/math/93c44d176051e93323d93e84baf3dc32fd6e3385.png" alt="max\ data\ rate"/>
(<img class="math" src="_images/math/d4e3b7b525c72434a1a98db671d6244d133913fa.png" alt="MDR"/>), which again are both functions of time.  Just as
before, these functions are constant-valued between successive values
of <img class="math" src="_images/math/ef9270877405055756d345facd044e4ab297f858.png" alt="t"/> and are time-integrated to produce the <img class="math" src="_images/math/026c968a41e051d6065b6d42a8f2fb20326f4e10.png" alt="mean\ data"/>
and <img class="math" src="_images/math/73aa92f05c2eca9e84b4acd363c3b97530e58640.png" alt="max\ data"/> cumulative profiles as functions of time.  With
this specification, we no longer know exactly how much data an
application will produce at a given point in time, but instead are
provided two values by the developer: the <img class="math" src="_images/math/d848cef57efa4f3c97e11490921df7d760a445b2.png" alt="mean"/> and
<img class="math" src="_images/math/244a015597005c01cf64d7a028918ccfefd5eee7.png" alt="max"/>.</p>
<p>Now that we have these two profiles for the application, we could
simply analyze the <img class="math" src="_images/math/244a015597005c01cf64d7a028918ccfefd5eee7.png" alt="max"/> data profile to determine buffer and
latency requirements, but this would end up wasting resources by
allocating memory and network resources of the system to the
application even if is not producing data at its <em>max rate</em>.  Instead,
we analyze the system according to the <img class="math" src="_images/math/d848cef57efa4f3c97e11490921df7d760a445b2.png" alt="mean"/> data profile to
determine buffer requirements and latency for the application in the
system.  In doing so, two buffer overflow risks are possible:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Sender-side buffer overflow</li>
<li>Receiver-side buffer overflow</li>
</ul>
<p>We make the assumption that the application meters its sending to
prevent the first scenario, so that its data is not lost before making
it onto the network.  In this case, the sender can still send data at
a rate greater than the <img class="math" src="_images/math/d848cef57efa4f3c97e11490921df7d760a445b2.png" alt="mean"/>, but that rate is partially
governed by the capacity given to it by the node&#8217;s network.</p>
<p>For the second case, we must ensure that there is no buffer overflow
on the receiver-side.  To enable this functionality, we must provide a
mechanism for the receiver to communicate with the sender.  This
push-back communication should travel through a channel outside the
communications channel that the application has access to, so that the
application, either maliciously or inadvertently, cannot disrupt this
push-back and in turn cause the receiver&#8217;s buffer to overflow.  For
this reason, we add into the sender and receiver middleware an
out-of-band (OOB) channel that provides a communications layer between
all senders and receivers that is invisible to the application.  For
our component model and communications middleware, we have implemented
this OOB channel as a UDP multicast group.</p>
<p>Because the goal of this work is to only meter senders which are
producing <em>too much</em> data, we must define what <em>too much data</em> is.
Because we have developed these application profiles for analysis, and
these profiles describe the <img class="math" src="_images/math/2e6c76553063a94d2e1a8d12e23a6228b3b14ad5.png" alt="mDR"/> and <img class="math" src="_images/math/d4e3b7b525c72434a1a98db671d6244d133913fa.png" alt="MDR"/> of the
senders, they will be used to determine when a sender is sending too
much data.  In this paradigm, a sender is determined as behaving
anomalously (i.e. sending too much data) if the sender, <img class="math" src="_images/math/3f1a4e430c239029fe31b52c95bb3278d0bc3d49.png" alt="S_i"/> is
sending data at a rate <img class="math" src="_images/math/33b55130ff9da65d5f02b14607f87992664e71f0.png" alt="DR_i &gt; mDR_i"/>.  The assumption implicit
in this comparison is that the sender, to be able to make this
comparison, has full knowledge of <img class="math" src="_images/math/78c3eab1130bc97f9a4b2b65b9f782c29fc9af7d.png" alt="mDR_i"/>, since <img class="math" src="_images/math/78a867df45f544573456c6e21cfc5f6be736ac79.png" alt="DR_i"/> is
calculable on the receiver side.  If the receiver&#8217;s buffer is filling
up, it looks through the all of the measured <img class="math" src="_images/math/0448930ecd0b9bc5f1873722fb397111e2b57eb3.png" alt="DR"/> for each of
the senders it has been receiving data from, and compares it against
the sender&#8217;s <img class="math" src="_images/math/2e6c76553063a94d2e1a8d12e23a6228b3b14ad5.png" alt="mDR"/>.  If the comparison is <em>true</em>, it uses the
OOB channel to push back to that specific sender, informing the
sender-side middleware to stop transmitting data until the receiver
has re-enabled that sender&#8217;s transmission.  When the receiver has
emptied it&#8217;s buffer enough it can then use the OOB channel to
re-enable the disabled senders.</p>

<p>We have implemented the OOB channel communication into our sender and
receiver component code along with the profile measurement and
comparison.  Using these code generators, we are able to run
experiments validating that the receiver can properly manage its
buffer by throttling excessive senders during times of congestion.</p>
<p>We have shown experimentally (for the system in <a class="pageref" href="#fig-ddos">Figure  5</a>)
that, for example, a receiver side buffer size of 400000 bits, which
would normally grow to 459424 bits because of excessive data pumps on
the sender sides, is kept to 393792 by utilizing this out-of-band
channel and secure middleware.</p>
