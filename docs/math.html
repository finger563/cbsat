<p>This chapter describes the mathematical formalization behind the
network analysis techniques used by <em>Precise Network Performance
Prediction</em>, (<img class="math" src="_images/math/25e201674a37202d448849e78eb163897d9373f6.png" alt="PNP^2"/>).</p>

<span id="network-math-formalism"></span><h2>Mathematical Formalism<a class="headerlink" href="#mathematical-formalism" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To model the network capability of the system and the application
traffic patterns, we have developed a network modeling paradigm
similar to Network Calculus&#8217; traffic arrival curves and traffic shaper
service curves.</p>
<p>Similarly to Network Calculus&#8217; arrival curves and service curves, our
network profiles model how the network performance or application
traffic generation changes with respect to time.  Whereas Network
Calculus&#8217; modeling transforms application data profiles and network
service profiles into min and max curves for data received vs. size of
time-window, our models take a simpler, deterministic approach which
models exactly the data generated by the application and the data
which could be sent through the network, allowing our performance
metrics to be more precise.  Specifically, the bandwidth that the
network provides on a given communication link is specified as a time
series of scalar bandwidth values. Here, bandwidth is defined as data
rate, i.e. bits per second, over some averaging interval.  This
bandwidth profile can then be time-integrated to determine the maximum
amount of data throughput the network link could provide over a given
time.  The bandwidth profile for the application traffic similarly can
be time-integrated to determine the amount of data that the
application attempts to send on the network link as a function of
time.</p>
<p>Having time-integrated the bandwidth profiles to obtain data vs. time
profiles that the application requires and that the system provides,
we can use a special type of convolution (<img class="math" src="_images/math/58f7acd8e0a3bb3e46d50b29fa7a2fb35fb1a41a.png" alt="\otimes"/>),
<em>(min,+)-calculus convolution</em>, on these two profiles to obtain the
transmitted link data profile as a function of discrete time. The
convolution we define on these profiles borrows concepts from the
min-plus calculus used in Network Calculus, but does not use a
sliding-window and instead takes the transformed minimum of the
profiles. For a given application data generation profile,
<img class="math" src="_images/math/8d85052c33844b2074fa63b28dcb671b60af6411.png" alt="r[t]"/>, and a given system link capacity profile <img class="math" src="_images/math/0dbbb6284c52a5c09f5b48ad92262621f105e135.png" alt="p[t]"/>,
where <img class="math" src="_images/math/dabb2a80e171850efb7893179444bbcf3d9befa8.png" alt="t\in\mathbb{N}"/>, the link transmitted data profile
<img class="math" src="_images/math/c52328274518603a2cc478a4db8925ffa035faed.png" alt="l[t]"/> is given by the convolution equation
<a href="#equation-convolution">(1)</a>. The difference <img class="math" src="_images/math/9465858efbe52662754f887345be2050bbba2c0d.png" alt="(p[t-1] - l[t-1])"/> represents
the difference between the amount of data that has been transmitted on
the link <img class="math" src="_images/math/134395d31a37b43835aaa38482a8b40111cf297b.png" alt="(l[t-1])"/> and the data that the link could have
transmitted at full utilization <img class="math" src="_images/math/9c3f19d8351f954b7742f329357f44e13a73aded.png" alt="(p[t-1])"/>. As demonstrated by
the convolution equation, <img class="math" src="_images/math/10089afa2b64cbf0fa8f9c9d7c42e44f3dcb0e40.png" alt="\forall t : l[t] \le r[t]"/>, which is
the relation that, without lower-layer reliable transport, the link
cannot transmit more application data for the application than the
application requests as there will be packetization and communication
header overhead as well.  The buffer and delay equations
<a href="#equation-convolution">(1)</a> use the output of the convolution with the input
profile to predict the minimum required buffer size for lossless
tranmission and the maximum delay experienced by the transmitted data,
respectively.  A representative convolution example is shown below for
reference.</p>

<div class="section" id="assumptions-involved">
<span id="assumptions"></span><h2>Assumptions Involved<a class="headerlink" href="#assumptions-involved" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As with any type of system modeling and analysis paradigm, it is
important to remain aware of the types of systems the
modeling/analysis is applicable to, the requirements imposed on the
system by the model, and any edge cases or scenarios where the
analysis or modeling paradigm breaks down.</p>
<p>The major assumption that we make with this type of system modeling
and analysis is that we <em>can</em> know at design time what the system
network capacity and the application data production will be as a
(possibly periodic) function of time.  Of course, this assumption is
unrealistic for heavily data-dependent systems, but by performing some
code analysis and/or doing some controlled experiments, models of the
applications&#8217; behavior can be developed that can be analyzed.</p>
<p>Another key assumption and thus requirement of our modeling and
analysis framework is a system-wide synchronized clock which all nodes
use.  By this we mean that if two nodes produce data for a third node
at time <img class="math" src="_images/math/a95a6c7171c13a2e4d31779d50b05185acf84fd9.png" alt="t=3"/> seconds, they will produce their data at exactly
the same time.  This is required for the composition of profiles as they
traverse the network and are routed through nodes.  This assumption
restricts the types of systems for which our analysis can be most
useful, but is not a critical hindrance, as many such critical
systems, e.g. satellite constellations or UAVs have GPS synchronized
clocks, which provide such a foundation.</p>
<p>Another restriction with our modeling paradigm is that data-dependent
flows cannot be accurately represented, since we have no way of
modeling data-dependence.  A related assumption is processing power
and the ability of the software to adhere to the profiles: we assume
the applications are able to accurately and precisely follow their
data production profiles, regardless of the number of other components
on their hardware node.  Similarly, we assume that under all
circumstances, the service profile of a hardware node will be adhered to.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="factors-impacting-analysis">
<span id="impacts"></span><h2>Factors Impacting Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#factors-impacting-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is important when developing modeling and analysis techniques to
analyze how the analysis time and results are affected by changes in
the model.  This is especially true when trying to determine how
applicable new techniques are to large scale systems.  Models are
provided by the application and system developers and are described in
the form of bandwdith (bps) vs time that the application requires or
the system provides.  These profiles are a time series that maps a
given time to a given bandwdith.  Between two successive intervals,
the bandwidth is held constant.  Clearly, to represent changing
bandwidth over time, the developer must use sufficiently short enough
time intervals to allow step-wise approximation of the curve.
However, as with any system, there is a tradeoff between precision of
the model and the analysis time and results.</p>
<p>Because the fundamental mathematics are linear for our convolution,
our convolution scales with <img class="math" src="_images/math/03e5516c1889957839a83599a7a7c92de1e380f4.png" alt="O(n)"/>, where <img class="math" src="_images/math/413f8a8e40062a9090d9d50b88bc7b551b314c26.png" alt="n"/> is the total
number of intervals in all of the profiles analyzed.  It is worth
noting that this complexity is not the same as the <img class="math" src="_images/math/050b75980d00e72d3a1d37cb7d030ca5f0eb012c.png" alt="O(n^2)"/> or
<img class="math" src="_images/math/6b31155d10b2e9adec0a62d7e83af35de41be728.png" alt="O(n*log(n))"/> complexity that traditional convolution has.  This
decrease in complexity is due to our convolution only requiring a
single operation (comparison operation for the minimum) for each value
of <img class="math" src="_images/math/ef9270877405055756d345facd044e4ab297f858.png" alt="t"/>.  As such, each element in both of the profiles being
convolved only needs to be operated on once.</p>
<p>Clearly, the overall system analysis complexity depends on the
complexity of the system, so as the system scales and increases
routing complexity, so too will the analysis complexity.  However, for
all systems there is an asymptotically increasing precision for a
given increase in model precision and analysis time.</p>
