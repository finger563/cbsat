      The depth of the atmosphere, in meters.

      :rtype: float

   .. attribute:: has_atmospheric_oxygen

      `True` if there is oxygen in the atmosphere, required for air-breathing
      engines.

      :rtype: bool

   .. attribute:: reference_frame

      Gets the reference frame that is fixed relative to the celestial body.

      * The origin is at the center of the body.

      * The axes rotate with the body.

      * The x-axis points from the center of the body towards the intersection of
        the prime meridian and equator (the position at 0° longitude, 0° latitude).

      * The y-axis points from the center of the body towards the north pole.

      * The z-axis points from the center of the body towards the equator at 90°E longitude.

      :rtype: :class:`ReferenceFrame`

      .. figure:: /images/reference-frames/celestial-body.png
         :align: center

         Celestial body reference frame origin and axes. The equator is shown in
         blue, and the prime meridian in red.

   .. attribute:: non_rotating_reference_frame

      Gets the reference frame that is fixed relative to this celestial body, and
      orientated in a fixed direction (it does not rotate with the body).

      * The origin is at the center of the body.

      * The axes do not rotate.

      * The x-axis points in an arbitrary direction through the equator.

      * The y-axis points from the center of the body towards the north pole.

      * The z-axis points in an arbitrary direction through the equator.

      :rtype: :class:`ReferenceFrame`

   .. attribute:: orbital_reference_frame

      Gets the reference frame that is fixed relative to this celestial body, but
      orientated with the body's orbital prograde/normal/radial directions.

      * The origin is at the center of the body.

      * The axes rotate with the orbital prograde/normal/radial directions.

      * The x-axis points in the orbital anti-radial direction.

      * The y-axis points in the orbital prograde direction.

      * The z-axis points in the orbital normal direction.

      :rtype: :class:`ReferenceFrame`

   .. method:: position (reference_frame)

      Returns the position vector of the center of the body in the specified reference frame.

      :param ReferenceFrame reference__frame:
      :rtype: :class:`Vector3`

   .. method:: velocity (reference_frame)

      Returns the velocity vector of the body in the specified reference frame.

      :param ReferenceFrame reference_frame:
      :rtype: :class:`Vector3`

   .. method:: rotation (reference_frame)

      Returns the rotation of the body in the specified reference frame.

      :param ReferenceFrame reference_frame:
      :rtype: :class:`Quaternion`

   .. method:: direction (reference_frame)

      Returns the direction in which the north pole of the celestial body is
      pointing, as a unit vector, in the specified reference frame.

      :param ReferenceFrame reference_frame:
      :rtype: :class:`Vector3`

   .. method:: angular_velocity (reference_frame)

      Returns the angular velocity of the body in the specified reference
      frame. The magnitude of the vector is the rotational speed of the body, in
      radians per second, and the direction of the vector indicates the axis of
      rotation, using the right-hand rule.

      :param ReferenceFrame reference_frame:
      :rtype: :class:`Vector3`
