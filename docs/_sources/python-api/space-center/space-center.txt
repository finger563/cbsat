SpaceCenter
===========

.. class:: SpaceCenter

   The SpaceCenter service provides functionality to interact with Kerbal Space
   Program. This includes controlling the active vessel, managing it's
   resources, planning maneuver nodes and auto-piloting.

   .. attribute:: active_vessel

      Gets the currently active vessel.

      :rtype: :class:`Vessel`

   .. attribute:: vessels

      Gets a list of all the vessels in the game.

      :rtype: ``list`` ( :class:`Vessel` )

   .. attribute:: bodies

      Gets a dictionary of all celestial bodies (planets, moons, etc.) in the game,
      keyed by the name of the body.

      :rtype: ``dict`` ( string, :class:`CelestialBody` )

   .. attribute:: target_body

      Gets or sets the currently targeted celestial body.

      :rtype: :class:`CelestialBody`

   .. attribute:: target_vessel

      Gets or sets the currently targeted vessel.

      :rtype: :class:`Vessel`

   .. attribute:: target_docking_port

      Gets or sets the currently targeted docking port.

      :rtype: :class:`DockingPort`

   .. method:: clear_target ()

      Clears the current target.

   .. attribute:: ut

      Gets the current universal time in seconds.

      :rtype: double

   .. attribute:: g

      Gets the value of the `gravitational constant
      <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant>`_ G in
      :math:`N(m/kg)^2`.

      :rtype: float

   .. attribute:: warp_mode

      Gets the current time warp mode. Returns :attr:`WarpMode.none` if time
      warp is not active, :attr:`WarpMode.rails` if regular "on-rails" time warp
      is active, or :attr:`WarpMode.physics` if physical time warp is active.

      :rtype: :class:`WarpMode`

   .. attribute:: warp_rate

      Gets the current warp rate. This is the rate at which time is passing for
      either on-rails or physical time warp. For example, a value of 10 means
      time is passing 10x faster than normal. Returns 1 if time warp is not
      active.

      :rtype: float

   .. attribute:: warp_factor

      Gets the current warp factor. This is the index of the rate at which time
      is passing for either regular "on-rails" or physical time warp. Returns 0
      if time warp is not active. When in on-rails time warp, this is equal to
      :attr:`rails_warp_factor`, and in physics time warp, this is equal to
      :attr:`physics_warp_factor`.

      :rtype: int

   .. attribute:: rails_warp_factor

      Gets or sets the time warp rate, using regular "on-rails" time warp. A
      value between 0 and 7 inclusive. 0 means no time warp. Returns 0 if
      physical time warp is active.

      If requested time warp factor cannot be set, it will be set to the next
      lowest possible value. For example, if the vessel is too close to a
      planet. See `the KSP wiki
      <http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Time_warp>`_ for details.

      :rtype: int

   .. attribute:: physics_warp_factor

      Gets or sets the physical time warp rate. A value between 0 and 3
      inclusive. 0 means no time warp. Returns 0 if regular "on-rails" time warp
      is active.

      :rtype: int

   .. method:: can_rails_warp_at (factor)

      Returns true if regular "on-rails" time warp can be used, at the specified
      warp *factor*. The maximum time warp rate is limited by various factors --
      including how close the active vessel is to a planet. See `the KSP wiki
      <http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Time_warp>`_ for details.

      :param bool factor: The warp factor to check.
      :rtype: bool

   .. attribute:: maximum_rails_warp_factor

      Gets the current maximum regular "on-rails" warp factor that can be set. A
      value between 0 and 7 inclusive. See `the KSP wiki
      <http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Time_warp>`_ for details how the
      maximum warp factor is limited.

      :rtype: int

   .. method:: warp_to (ut, [max_rails_rate=100000], [max_physics_rate=2])

      Uses time acceleration to warp forward to a time in the future, specified
      by universal time *ut*. This call blocks until the desired time is
      reached. Uses regular "on-rails" or physical time warp as appropriate. For
      example, physical time warp is used when the active vessel is traveling
      through an atmosphere. When using regular "on-rails" time warp, the warp
      rate is limited by *max_rails_rate*, and when using physical time warp, the
      warp rate is limited by *max_physics_rate*.

      :param float ut: The universal time to warp to, in seconds
      :param float max_rails_rate: The maximum warp rate in regular "on-rails"
                                 time warp
      :param float max_physics_rate: The maximum warp rate in physical time warp
      :returns: When the time warp is complete.
